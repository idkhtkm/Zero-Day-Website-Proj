# Zero-Day-Website-Proj
my website based on the one that andre made in zero day (2003)

i made it all in HTML, it's simple because it's also simple in the movie, i just looked at what he showed in the presentation and copied it as faithfully as i could, i also put two players with descriptions, one for the movie and the other for the making of, hope i can get this website running soon, i just don't know if i'll have any problems...

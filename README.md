# Zero-Day-Website-Proj
i made it all in HTML, it's simple because it's also simple in the movie, i copied everything they show, the texts of the plan, the colour, the letter font, and i also put two players, one for the full movie and other for the making of, i dont know when i'll get a domain and if i'll do, btw the site is designed and works for both desktop and cell phone.

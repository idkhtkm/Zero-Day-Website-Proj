        <h1>SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS</h1>
        <p>
            • The School Resource Officer, otherwise know as the SRO is one of the main preliminary targets to be considered. 
            In order to maximize the effects of your attack, you should be sure to eliminate any opposition as soon as possible. 
            In this scenario, the SRO poses this threat, and should therefore be eliminated expeditiously.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="text-section">
        <h1>CONFINEMENT</h1>
        <p>
            • Confinement is an important part of any such invasion. Parameters for confinement have already been described, 
            so we will move on to its importance.
        </p>
        <p>
            • Confinement of the enemy is paramount in light of the fact that any who manages to escape can end your fun 
            prematurely by using a cell phone or other unforeseen means of communication to alert the outside world before it is convenient.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="text-section">
        <h1>THOROUGH ELIMINATION</h1>
        <p>
            • "if you're going to do something, you might as well do it right." -Somebody smart
        </p>
        <p>
            • Keeping to this logic, it is important that, when conducting a room-by-room assault, each room's population is 
            thoroughly and completely reduced. Otherwise, you may incur problems that were mentioned in the section on confinement.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="text-section">
        <h1>RETREAT</h1>
        <p>
            • The Army of Two has deemed it wise to have a secondary escape plan, should your plans go unforeseeably away. 
            However, it is not only unwise, but also counter-productive to rely too heavily on said plan, in light of the 
            fact that you may become too comfortable with its implementation.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="text-section">
        <h1>IN CLOSING</h1>
        <p>
            • The proceeding has been a basic, yet detailed outline for our mission ideals and objectives. 
            No two missions are the same, and therefore you should feel at liberty to operate freely within, 
            or outside, of these guidelines.
        </p>
    </div>

	• In conclusion, live fast, live hard, and die with any combination of these two.
